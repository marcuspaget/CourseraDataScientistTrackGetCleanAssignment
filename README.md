### Details


The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- README.md: this file

- CodeBook.md: Shows information about the variables, data sourcing and manipulation.

- run_analysis.R: The R code to analysis the data - merging sources and cleaning the data. Objectives:

	* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
	* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
	* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


- tidy.R: Tidy dataset as generated by run_analysis.R
